    Qiskit Terra's `qiskit.algorithms` module has been superseded by a
    new standalone library, ``qiskit_algorithms``.
    As of Qiskit Terra's 0.25 release, active development of new
    features has moved to this new package.
    If you're relying on :mod:`qiskit.algorithms` you should update your
    requirements to also include ``qiskit-algorithms`` and update the imports
    from ``qiskit.algorithms`` to ``qiskit_algorithms``. If you have not yet
    migrated from ``QuantumInstance``-based to primitives-based algorithms,
    you should follow the migration guidelines in https://qisk.it/algo_migration.
    The decision to migrate the :mod:`~.algorithms` module to a
    separate package was made to clarify the purpose Qiskit and
    make a distinction between the tools and libraries built on top of it.
